Don't you know how it is when you arrive in heaven? 
In heaven that's all they talk about — the ocean — and how wonderful it is. 
They talk about the sunsets they have seen. 
They talk about how the sun turned blood-red before it set. 
And they talk about how they felt when the sun was loosing its power, — and the cold that was coming from the ocean, while the rest of the fire was still glowing. 
And you - You can't talk about it with them, since you have never been there! 
You will be a fucking outsider up there! 
And there is nothing we can do about it?
