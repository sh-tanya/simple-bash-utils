Development of Bash text utilities: `cat`, `grep`.

### cat Usage

Cat is one of the most frequently used commands on Unix-like operating systems. It has three related functions with regard to text files: displaying them, combining copies of them and creating new ones.

`cat [OPTION] [FILE]...`

### cat Options

| No. | Options | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 1 | -b (GNU: --number-nonblank) | numbers only non-empty lines |
| 2 | -e implies -v (GNU only: -E the same, but without implying -v) | but also display end-of-line characters as $  |
| 3 | -n (GNU: --number) | number all output lines |
| 4 | -s (GNU: --squeeze-blank) | squeeze multiple adjacent blank lines |
| 5 | -t implies -v (GNU: -T the same, but without implying -v) | but also display tabs as ^I  |

### grep Usage

`grep [options] template [file_name]`

### grep Options

| No. | Options | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 1 | -e | pattern |
| 2 | -i | Ignore uppercase vs. lowercase.  |
| 3 | -v | Invert match. |
| 4 | -c | Output count of matching lines only. |
| 5 | -l | Output matching files only.  |
| 6 | -n | Precede each matching line with a line number. |
| 7 | -h | Output matching lines without preceding them by file names. |
| 8 | -s | Suppress error messages about nonexistent or unreadable files. |
| 9 | -o | Output the matched parts of a matching line. |

### According to my task:

- The library is developed in C language of C11 standard using gcc compiler

- Code is checked following the Google style

- The programs are built with Makefile with appropriate targets: s21_cat, s21_grep

- Integration tests cover all flag variants and input values, based on a comparison with the behavior of real Bash utilities 

- Cat utility supports all the flags (including GNU versions) specified above

- Grep utility supports all the flags specified above (including their pair combinations)

- Regex libraries are used for regular expressions
